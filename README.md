# Lightweight NAS
### A lightweight training strategy for NAS. 

In this software, we provide a lightweight training strategy for neural architecture search (NAS). 

Our training strategy enables a NAS algorithm to accurately find good neural architectures with a small number of training neural architectures (i.e., neural architectures equipped with)

Specifically, we first train a NAS method to better understand the structure of neural architectures and then train the NAS method to accurately predict the performance of a given neural architecture.


## Code guideline

One can refer to ```run.py``` file to see how our NAS algorithm works.
