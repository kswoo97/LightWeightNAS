# NAS-Pretraining
### A mutable neural architecture project. 

This project aims to develop an automated algorithm that enables a neural network to adaptively mutate, enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

## Regarding our flow surrogate.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook named ```obtaining_flow_surrogate.ipynb```.
